# LLVM-Kaleidoscope

## Introduction
This is a demo project guided by [LLVM tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html). Most of the contents are same(or very similar) to the tutorial code. I want to use this demo to get familiar with LLVM and learn the basic ideas of compilers.
